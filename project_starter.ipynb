    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calculation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generate a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

The trip is scheduled from June 10 to June 12, 2025, with a total budget of 130 units, and the planned activities fit well within this limit with a total cost of 123. The itinerary thoughtfully balances both travelers’ interests while considering the weather and event settings.\n\nOn the first day, June 10, the weather will be clear with a warm temperature of 31°C, ideal for outdoor activities. The morning starts with a FutureTech Breakfast Meet-Up at the Innovation Atrium, perfect for Yuri’s enthusiasm for technology in a comfortable indoor setting. Later at noon, “Serve & Savor: Tennis and Taste Luncheon” combines tennis and cooking in an engaging outdoor event that suits Yuri’s interests in both. In the evening, Hiro can enjoy a relaxing and creative time at the AgentsVille Twilight Writing Escape, an indoor activity that caters to his passions for reading and art in a social, low-key environment.\n\nOn June 11, the temperature climbs to around 34°C with partly cloudy skies, making it a good day for a mix of indoor and outdoor experiences. Midday offers the Tech Lunch & Learn: AI Frontiers at The Digital Atrium, providing an immersive learning and networking opportunity that appeals to Yuri’s technology interest and also aligns well with Hiro’s appreciation for music and creative tech themes. The afternoon transitions outdoors to the AgentsVille Art & Music Fusion Fest at the Echo Gardens Amphitheater, where both travelers will enjoy live music and interactive art exhibits, ideally matching Hiro’s love for art and music in a vibrant atmosphere.\n\nThe final day, June 12, brings a cooler temperature of 28°C with predicted thunderstorms, so the itinerary includes flexible options. During lunchtime, the Soundtrack Picnic at Starlight Amphitheater blends movies and music with the comfort of moving indoors if the rain comes, which suits both travelers’ shared interests. In the evening, the Tech & Film Fusion Night at the Virtual Reality Theater combines Yuri’s passion for technology and Hiro’s interest in movies in an immersive indoor setting, perfect for the weather and offering a unique experience to end the trip.\n\nOverall, this carefully curated itinerary provides an engaging balance of indoor and outdoor activities while highlighting the shared and individual interests of both Yuri and Hiro throughout their stay in AgentsVille."
